Description:
An extremely simple program to launch a user defined steam game. The program can then be used
as a target for shortcuts that can be customized, yet retain the "Launched through steam" behaviour.

Why:
Some games do not like to be launched directly from their .exe file, and will instead force you to launch it either through
steam or a steam generated shortcut (which cannot be customized).

Usage:
1. Place the contents of this zip file in your game's steam folder.
2. Add the game's steam appID to the SteamLauncher.ini configuration file.
3. Create a shortcut to the SteamLauncher.exe program on your desktop or start menu.
4. Customize the shortcut's icon. ex: Point it to the game's real .exe file to use the game's icon.
5. Use 3rd party tools to create a windows 10 tile for this shortcut.

How to get the game's AppID:
1. Right click the game in steam and choose "Create desktop Shortcut".
2. Right click the newly created shortcut and choose "properties".
3. In the target field copy the number after the last "/" character. ex: steam://rungameid/287700

OR

Navigate to the game's store page on steam in a web browser. The AppID will be in the URL of the page.
